Research Projects
======
* Axions in Dense Quark Matter (Master Thesis at University of Catania)
  * Investigated the effective action of QCD axions in dense quark matter.
  * Explored axion interactions in color-superconducting phases, symmetry breaking, and potential applications to compact stellar objects. Calculated axion mass, topological susceptibiltiy, and self-coupling in various superconducting phases.
