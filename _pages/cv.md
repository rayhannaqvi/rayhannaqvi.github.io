Education
======
* European Master In Nuclear Physics, Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Degree (EMJMD), 2024
  * University of Catania (S4)
  * University of Caen (S3)
  * University of Sevilla (S1, S2)
* B.S in Physics, COMSATS Unviersity, 2021


Research Projects
======
* Axions in Dense Quark Matter (Master Thesis at University of Catania)
  * Investigated the effective action of QCD axions in dense quark matter.
  * Explored axion interactions in color-superconducting phases, symmetry breaking, and potential applications to compact stellar objects. Calculated axion mass, topological susceptibiltiy, and self-coupling in various superconducting phases.
* The Diffusion of Pulsars in the P - P Diagram (Internship at LPC Caen)
  * Focused on pulsar evolution and diffusion in the P-P diagram, analyzing stochastic models of timing noise using Python routine.
* Generic Polynomial Inflationary Potentials and Cosmological Perturbations (Bachelor Thesis at COMSATS University)
  * Studied hybrid inflation models with chaotic polynomial potentials under slow-rollapproximation.
  * Addressed plausibility of the model with Planck data bounds by incorporating fermionic radiative corrections.
