There are two famous Principia Mathematica in the history of scientific literature. The effectiveness of the first Principia authored by Isaac Newton is beyond doubt. It was published in 1687 and laid the foundations of classical mechanics and universal gravitation. The modern scientific infrastructure and empirical precision stands on the contributions of Principia. The second Principia, of which this article is about, was written by long struggle and turmoils of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead. 


I have recently came across a comic book named "Logicomix" written by Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos Papadimitriou. It was my first introduction into the universe of graphic novels, because I am still in more awe of the words describing the pictures than the pictures directing the essence the words. I am not trying to act Wittgensteinian to talk about theory of language and images, even though the comic does talk about it. The reason really was the interest in the foundations of mathematics and logic, and the history of logicist's fanatic obsession of reducing mathematics to logic. It is already known how that project ended. For brief understanding, one can see the painting of Danaïdes by John William Waterhouse. The myth signifying fifty daughters of Danaus, king of Libya, condemned by the Gods to pour water in the leaking jar.

The Logicomix gives the central character to Russell himself who is lecturing in an American university on the "Role of Logic in Human Affairs." This fictional lecture is inspired by Russell's lecture series during 1939 (at least I am unable to find the actual lecture content online). The literary freedom is used exceptionally well, many events are fictionally created in a way that the story of evolution of logicist's project becomes exhaustively clear. Not just the problems of mathematics are discussed but also how the obsession of founding mathematics on comprehensive logical basis after the works of Frege and Boole led Russell to the verge of insanity. Russell realized that self-referential paradoxes (e.g. Russel's paradox) exposed the structure of set-theory which underpinned most of the mathematics developing at that time. He and Whitehead tried years to develop theory of types to dissolve the distance between maths and pure logic. Russell used to joke about how many people have really read the Principia:

> "I used to know of only six people who had read the later parts of the book [Principia Mathematica]."
> 
> — *Bertrand Russell*

The struggle ultimately failed when Hilbert put forward major unresolved problems in mathematics: one of them which was to have a proof of completeness of mathematics and Godel came up with the solution that it was not possible. This failure of the project pushed deeper thinking into logic, formal systems, and computability. It is true that the second Principia is not as influential as the first one, but you can ask: Will there be computers without it? Probably not this soon.
